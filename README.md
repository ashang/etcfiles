## etc files collections
These files keep what I had collected for easy life during years of using Linux/BSD as daily computers.

The files would be in sync among my x86-64, PowerPC, ARM boxes, running latest Arch, Debian, Gentoo, Ubuntu Linux.

Some tunings may be needed to work on different distro rules or styles.
