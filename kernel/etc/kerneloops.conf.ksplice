# Configuration file for the kerneloops.org kernel crash collector

# Ksplice Uptrackâ„¢ configures kerneloops to send oops reports to the
# Uptrack developers to help us monitor for any potential problems
# related to our service.  See
# <http://www.ksplice.com/uptrack/privacy> for our privacy policy,
# which covers this and other information submitted to Ksplice servers
# by the Ksplice Uptrack service.
#

#
# Change this variable to 'no' to disable sending oops reports to the
# Ksplice Uptrack developers.
#
# Because of an oddity in how Ubuntu's kernelwatch package works, setting this
# to 'ask' causes oopses to be automatically submitted to the Uptrack
# developers. There is no way to make kerneloops prompt you about submitting
# oopses to Ksplice.

# URL for submitting the oopses

# Note that due to a bug in kerneloops, the kerneloops will continue to claim
# oopses are being reported directly to kerneloops.org, regardless of the value
# of 'submit-url'.
